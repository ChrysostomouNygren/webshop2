# [Stupid ugly webshop](https://anotherwebshop.netlify.app/)
This is stupid and I don't recommend it.\
Webshop made in React JS as a school project. It is ugly and stupid. Don't look at it.

### Get started:

### `npm install`
Will install all the neccessary node_modules. Big file, don't recommend it.

### `npm run dev`
Do it at your own risk, might cause your eyes to bleed.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
